## How to Integrate SQL Server 2022 with Purview

### Registering the SQL Server Database in Purview

- Go to the [Microsoft Purview Studio](https://web.purview.azure.com/).
- Navigate to **Data Map** > **Register** > **SQL Server**.
- Provide the required connection details (server name, authentication, etc.).
- Set up a scan rule set to define what metadata and classifications to extract.
- Schedule regular scans to keep metadata and classifications up to date.

### Enabling Unity Data Governance

- Use **Unity Catalog** within Purview to manage access policies, data lineage, and data sharing.
- Assign roles such as Data Owner, Data Steward, and Data Consumer to control access and responsibilities.
- Track data movement and transformations for compliance and auditing.

### Data Classification and Labeling

- Apply built-in or custom classifiers to automatically detect and label sensitive data (e.g., PII, financial data).
- Use labels to drive downstream policies such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and access controls.

## Managing DLP (Data Loss Prevention) Projects

> DLP projects in Purview help you identify, monitor, and protect sensitive data within your SQL Server databases.

<details>
<summary><b>E.g: DLP Policy for Customer PII</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> Prevent unauthorized export of customer personally identifiable information (PII).

**Steps:**

1. **Create a DLP Policy:** In Purview, define a policy targeting tables/columns with PII (e.g., email, SSN).
2. **Define Detection Rules:** Use built-in or custom classifiers to identify PII fields.
3. **Set Actions:**  
   - Alert data owners when PII is accessed or exported.
   - Optionally, block export or require additional approval for sensitive data.
4. **Monitor and Audit:** Use Purviewâ€™s monitoring dashboard to track policy violations and data access patterns.

<details>
<summary><b>E.g: DLP Policy for Financial Records</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> Prevent unauthorized access or leak of payroll, tax records, and bank account data.

**Steps:**

1. **Create a DLP Policy:** Target tables like `Payroll`, `Invoices`, or `TaxDocuments`.
2. **Define Detection Rules:** Use financial classifiers to detect fields like `account_number`, `routing_number`, `salary`, etc.
3. **Set Actions:**  
   - Mask fields for non-authorized users.  
   - Trigger real-time alerts for exports or downloads.
4. **Monitor and Audit:** Audit trail of accesses to sensitive financial information.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>E.g: DLP Policy for Intellectual Property (IP)</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> Protect proprietary formulas, product designs, or source code stored in SQL Server.

**Steps:**

1. **Create a DLP Policy:** Focus on R&D tables like `ProductDesign`, `AlgorithmSpecs`, or `Blueprints`.
2. **Define Detection Rules:** Customize classifiers using keywords or phrases tied to internal IP.
3. **Set Actions:**  
   - Block queries from external users or consultants.  
   - Require dual-approval for exports or backups.
4. **Monitor and Audit:** Flag and investigate unusual access patterns.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>E.g: DLP Policy for Healthcare Data (HIPAA)</b> (Click to expand)</summary>

> Comply with healthcare regulations by securing patient records and medical history.

**Steps:**

1. **Create a DLP Policy:** Target tables containing `diagnosis_codes`, `treatment_notes`, or `insurance_info`.
2. **Define Detection Rules:** Enable built-in classifiers for HIPAA-related entities such as `Patient ID`, `Diagnosis`, `Prescriptions`.
3. **Set Actions:**  
   - Encrypt or mask records during query outputs.  
   - Notify compliance officers of any unauthorized attempts.
4. **Monitor and Audit:** Include incident tracking for audits and regulatory reporting.

## Cost Management and Budgeting

> **Microsoft Purview Account:**: Billed per vCore-hour and per GB of data processed during scans.
> The pricing structure is based on:
>
> - **Data Map** (capacity units, always-on)
> - **Scanning** (pay-as-you-go, based on vCore usage and scan duration)
> - **Managed Virtual Network** and **API/Data Transfer** costs for cross-cloud governance
> - **Resource Set Processing** (based on processing time)

## Best Practices

- **Automate Scans:** Schedule regular scans to keep metadata and classifications current.
- **Least Privilege:** Assign only necessary permissions to users and service principals.
- **Monitor Usage:** Regularly review Purview dashboards for unusual activity or policy violations.
- **Review Costs:** Monitor Purview and SQL Server usage to optimize resource allocation and control expenses.

## Integration with Purview for Unity Catalog

> SQL Server 2022 can be integrated with Microsoft Purview to enable a Unity Catalog for data governance and management. This integration allows you to:

- Discover and classify sensitive data.
- Track data lineage across your SQL Server databases.
- Enable centralized data governance.

### Steps to Integrate

1. **Register the SQL Server Database**:
   - Navigate to the Microsoft Purview portal.
   - Register your SQL Server 2022 as a data source.
2. **Scan the Data Source**:
   - Configure scanning rules to classify and catalog the data.
   - Schedule periodic scans to keep the catalog updated.
3. **Manage Data Lineage**: Use Purview to visualize data lineage across your SQL Server databases.
4. **Set Up Access Policies**: Define access policies for data governance using Purview.

### Benefits

- Enhanced data discovery and classification.
- Improved compliance and governance.
- Centralized management of data assets.
